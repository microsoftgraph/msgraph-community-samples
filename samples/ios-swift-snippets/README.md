# Microsoft Graph iOS Swift Snippets Sample

Code snippets that use the Microsoft Graph to perform common tasks, such as sending email or managing groups, from within an iOS app written in Swift. This sample uses the Microsoft Graph Client Library to work with the data, and uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for authentication of users' work or school Office 365 accounts.
